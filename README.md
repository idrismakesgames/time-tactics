# Timeline Tactics Prototype
Space based tactics game that using timeline and planning to win.

Ideas

1. Phantom Brigade combat with ships and abilities based on party and characters. mix of opus magnum in there. 
2. Oxenfree for dialogue and movement on ship and throughout base. 
3. Maybe characters have sleep schedules.
4. Everything 2d and square and MUST be fun.
5. Send off fighters, missiles, shields, beams, movement, stealth, boost, teleports, etc.
6. Walk around ship and talk to team, solve issues and puzzles, fly to differentplanets and systems and areas.
7. Maybe get translators and stuff like that. so comms, offence, defense, skills, engineering. etc. ship is the main hp thing.
8. Missions could be guidance and escorting when you just need to distract the heavy ships and be a nuisance until you are good enough.
9. Upgrade ship and build it up  so you can have better targetting and destroy full ships.
10. Have obstacles and environment elements to help player not just cover 
11. Gravity wells maybe.
12. What if you could spawn in enemies into the scene into specific areas to increase bounty
13. what if it was like an editor sutie but you are planning a heist or something.
